Hello there 👋🏻  

I'm an MSc student in Engineering Physics at Técnico Lisboa.

My main academic and research interest is Radiation Physics; I'm particularly interested in the applications to the Space and Medical fields, as well as Radiation shielding. I've tailored my Masters degree to accomodate these interests and still give me strong foundations in other subjects, such as Plasma Physics and Nanoelectronics.

I'm a member of NuclearVision Portugal, a group of students that aims to raise awareness to the advantages of using Nuclear Energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.
